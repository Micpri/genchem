Step 3: emep_setup.py
+++++++++++++++++++++

The do.testChem script described above is best for quickly testing and 
comparing different mechanisms. Usually these comparisons only involve
gas-phase mechanisms such as EmChem19a or MCM_v3.3. However, the EMEP
model usually requires a host of extra species and reactions to 
accommodate sea-salt, dust, organic aerosols, and pollen.
It also requires files to specify how emissions and boundary
conditions should be distributed among specific species, e.g.
how a VOC emission should be split into C2H6, C2H4, nC4H10 etc.

In fact, for the EMEP model, GenChem produces many files which are
copied into the ZCM\_XXX directories for the scheme XXX you wish to use: 

   $ls -x ZCM_EmChem19a/

    CM_ChemDims_mod.f90                     CM_ChemGroups_mod.f90
    CM_ChemRates_mod.f90                    CM_ChemSpecs_mod.f90
    CM_DryDep.inc                           CM_EmisFile.inc
    CM_emislist.csv                         CM_EmisSpecs.inc
    CM_Reactions1.inc                       CM_Reactions2.inc
    CM_Reactions.log                        CM_WetDep.inc
    CMX_BiomassBurningMapping_FINNv1.5.txt  CMX_BiomassBurningMapping_GFASv1.txt
    CMX_BoundaryConditions.txt              config_box.nml
    run_emislist/  (with emislist.defaults.sox etc..)


The recommended way to get this directory is to use the script *emep_setup.py* from your temporary work directory
within  the **box** system. So, from e.g. box/tmp_work, do:

  ./emep_setup.py  EmChem19a

or just::

  ./emep_setup.py

and this will provide a list of options.


You can edit the *emep_setup.py* scripts, maybe renaming it as *my_setup.py* directory. 
If selecting from the provided base\_mechanisms and extra\_mechanisms you only need to extend
the possible command lines as provided by the *cmdx*  dictionary::

  cmdx['EmChem19a'] ='-b EmChem19a -e PM_VBS_EmChem19 BVOC_MTERP1_EmChem19'+common
  cmdx['CRI-R5-emep'] ='-b CRI-R5-emep -e common'


The '-b' argument gives the base mechanism, and then you can have any number of compatable extra mechanisms (-e argument).

Any keys from *cmdx* can be used by *emep_setup.py*. For example, if the user builds a new base scheme *usersChem* and
some OA scheme, *usersSOA*, then *emep_setup.py* can be edited to add these as a new option::

  cmdx['usersChem'] ='-b usersChem -e  usersSOA'+common

you could do::

  do.testChems usersChem   # GOOD TO CHECK FIRST

  emep_setup.py usersChem  # Creates ZCM_usersChem
