  COMMENTED
  This mechanism provides organic aerosol reactions as used in the
  standard EMEP model of Simpson et al., Atmos. Chem. Physics, 2012 for
  the EmChem09soa case - the latter is essentially produced by
  doGenChem.py -b EmChem09 -e VBS_acp2012.

  VBS denotes volatility basis set, from the work of Donahue, Robinson etc.,
  and following the EMEP implementations documented in Bergstr√∂m et al.,
  Atmos. Chem. Physics, 2012. (The EmChem09soa case uses inert emissions
  of promary organic aerosol.)

Formatting of GenChem files

Reactions files
+++++++++++++++

Example::

  * Some simple lines
  1.4e-12*EXP(-1310.*TINV)          : O3 + NO    = NO2 + <O2>  ; acp2004
  5.681e-34*EXP(-2.6*LogTdiv300)    : OP + <O2> + <M>  = O3 ; acp2004
  2.15e-11*EXP(110.*TINV)           : OD + <N2>  = OP       ; Updated (IUPAC 2009)

  emisfiles:sox,nox,co,voc,nh3
  rcemis(NO,KDIM)                        : = NO  ;


*   END-OF-LINE is ";". Text after this (e.g. references, or unused "products") will be ignored. 
*   Separator between rate coefficient and reaction is ":".
*   lines beginning with "*" are comments (no ";" needed here)
*   lines beginning with "rcemis" are emission terms  
*   lines beginning with "emisfiles" give name of  emission files, e.g. nox
*   Some coefficients are defined in GenIn.shorthand, e.g. TINV, LogTdiv300 
*   Anything else is simply used as the rate coefficient. (Do not add spaces!)  



Four  types of tracers/catalysts/yields are allowed, denoted by different types of parentheses:

 1) e.g. [OH] + VOC -> SOA   will put xnew(OH) into the loss rate of VOC, but will not change the loss rate of OH.

 2) e.g. {O2} + OD -> OP   will ignore the O2 term. Make sure it is in the reaction rate though if needed!

 3) e.g. OP + <O2> + <M> -> O3  will ignore the O2 and M term AND add their concentrations to the reaction rate (multiply it). This system is only used for these "special" species (O2, N2, M) as they must be pre-defined, e.g. O2(k), in boxChem and/or EMEP codes.

 4) e.g. 1.36e-11 :   [OXYL] + [OH] = \|YCOXY(0)\|  ASOC_ug1  + ...  will replace the contents of the || term with yield coefficients which will be updated each time-step in the EMEP model.  These variables (here YCOXY(0)) must be predefined in order for emep\_setup.py and the emep model to compile.



Species files
+++++++++++++++

The input to the GenChem.py script is GenIn\_Species.csv, but this
is assembled by do.GenChem from all needed  \_Species.csv files from
the base_mechanisms and extra_mechanisms sub-directories. For For
example, for a typical emep run with base EmChem19a, do.GenChem
appends EmChem19a\_Species.csv, SeaSalt\_Species.csv, and many more into
one GenIn\_Species.csv. The file contains columns with species
name, type, formula, and various settings related to dry and wet deposition

Example lines::

  Spec,adv,formula,MW,DRY,WET,Groups,!Comments
  *
  RO2POOL,1,RO2POOL,xx,xx,xx,xx,!
  OD,0,O,xx,xx,xx,xx,!
  NO2,1,NO2,xx,NO2,xx,NOx;OX;OXN;daObs,!
  MACR,1,CH2=CCH3CHO,xx,MEK,xx,RCHO;carbonyl;Hstar_5p0e0;f0_0p05;DRx_2p6,!
  BSOC_ng1e2,2,C,12.,ALD,ROOH,Cstar:0.1;DeltaH:30.0;OM25;PCM;BSOA,"! semi-volatile OC from BVOC "

Shorthands file
+++++++++++++++

Shorthands are text-strings used in the Reactions.txt file, usually to represent commonly used rate-coefficients. The meaning of the text-string is given in \_Shorthand.txt file, e.g.  ::

  XT           temp
  FH2O         (1.0+1.4e-21*h2o*exp(2200.0*TINV))
  KHO2RO2      2.91e-13*exp(1300.*TINV) ! MCM2001 ...
  KMT12        IUPAC_troe(2.8e-31*exp(2.6*Log300divT),2.0e-12,exp(-TEMP/472.),M,0.75-1.27*(-TEMP/472.)/LOG(10.))

In these examples, XT is just a character-saving replacement for temp, FH2O gives a more complex expression, which also uses the pre-defined variable TINV = 1/temp. KHO2RO2 is a common rate-coefficient, but here we see that comments are allowed - anything afer the 2nd term. FInally, the KMT12 term shows that complex fuction calls are also allowed. IMPORTANT - avoid white space in any terms!
