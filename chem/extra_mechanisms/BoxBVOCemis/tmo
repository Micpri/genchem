* has a reasonably realistic diurnal variation.
* As example emission rates, we use the default broadleaf and coniferous
* from Simpson et al, ACP, 2012:
* broadleaf Iso with e=5ug/g/h, D=320 g/m2, Hmix=1000m has emission in #/cm3/s of 3.94e6
* coniferous MT with emtp=1ug/g/h emtl=1ug/h, D=500 g/m2, Hmix=1000m has emission in #/cm3/s of 6.4e5
* with MT maybe controlled 50% by SUN and 50% by just temperature
