* <----------- Biogenic/natural emissions ----------------------------->
* VERY simplified system for box model testing.
* BVOC emissions for case of isoprene + all monoterpenes as APINENE
*
* if wanted, SQT is in extra_mechanisms/BVOC_SQT_NV
*
* BoxBVOC: use SUN as driver, where SUN has value 1.0 at noon, zero at night, and
* has a reasonably realistic diurnal variation.
* As example emission rates, we use the default broadleaf and coniferous
* from Simpson et al, ACP, 2012:
* broadleaf Iso with e=5ug/g/h, D=320 g/m2, Hmix=1000m has emission in #/cm3/s of 3.94e6
* coniferous MT with emtp=1ug/g/h emtl=1ug/h, D=500 g/m2, Hmix=1000m has emission in #/cm3/s of 6.4e5
* with MT maybe controlled 50% by SUN and 50% by just temperature 

4.0e6*SUN*fIsop : =  C5H8  ;
6.0e5*SUN*fMTL  : =  APINENE  ; 
6.0e5*fMTP      : =  APINENE  ;
