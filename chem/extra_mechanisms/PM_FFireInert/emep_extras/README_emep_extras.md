EMEP extras
===========

These files will be used by the EMEP MSC-W 3-D model. They provide
links between GenChem's chemical species and various externally-provided
boundary conditions or biomass burning compounds. These files have to
created by hand for now, but some hard-coding will always be needed to
map external names to emep species names.

Biomass burning
---------------

So far two setups are needed, for either the FINN or GFAS sources of
wildfires:

emep_BiomassBurning_FINNv1.5.txt
emep_BiomassBurning_GFASv1.txt

These files address PM emissions of the ffire species. A tracer of
CO emissions can be found in FFiretracers


Boumdary condition mapping
