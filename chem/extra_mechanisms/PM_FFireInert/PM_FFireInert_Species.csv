* Forest fire species for inert emissions of the three species for
* typical EMEP usage.
* For ffire emissions, we need an OM/OC ratio consistent with BiomassBurning
* Mapping. 1.7 x 12 = 20.4
* Wildfire OC emissions, OM/OC assumed to be =1.7 (loosely based on Aiken et al. 2008)"
* IMPORTANT! REMEMBER to NOT include the PM10 and PMfine groups for the fine
*  (PM2.5) Organic components! Taken care of by the help species PART_OM_F!
*
* See FFireTracers for the tracer species ffire_CO if wanted.
