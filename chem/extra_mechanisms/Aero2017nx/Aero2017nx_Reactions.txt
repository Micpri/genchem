* Aero2017nx is similar to that used in Stadtler et al 2017, but based
* upon that paper we now skip some reactions.

* The earlier (than EmCHem16x) EmChems had N2O5 hydrolysis on PMfine. Not included here
* JUNE 2018: Now, put here:

HydrolysisN2O5() :       N2O5 = 2 HNO3 ;

* And GenChem only accepts one colon. We use KDIM for the first

UptakeRate(cNO3,gam=0.001,S=S_m2m3(AERO%PM,KDIM))   : NO3 = HNO3 ;

UptakeRate(cHNO3,gam=0.1,S=S_m2m3(AERO%DU_C,KDIM))  : HNO3 = NO3_c ;

UptakeRate(cHNO3,gam=0.01,S=S_m2m3(AERO%SS_C,KDIM)) : HNO3 = NO3_c ;

UptakeRate(cHO2,gam=0.2,S=S_m2m3(AERO%PM,KDIM))     : HO2 = 0.5 H2O2 ;

 1.0e-5                            : H2O2 =       ;
 1.0e-5                            : CH3OOH =    ;

* Notes:
* Dust,  Dentener had gamma=0.1, but maybe only allow some Ca reaction, ca. 
* 5% of surface?  Hodzic tested several values, finding 0.1 best, but with
* assumed Ca+Mg of 17%, which means (I think) effective gamma = 0.017

* HNO3 (NaCl + HNO3 -> NO3_c). Only consider coarse mode as we don't have NaNO3_f)
* Sea-salt, Use instead Dentener's high gamma * Haldis used 0.2

* HO2 : gamma = 0.2, Jacob. Both fine and coarse?
