PM handling for VBS treatment in EmChem19 also usable with CRIv2R5Em

Similar to VBS scheme used in Bergstr√∂m et al, ACP, 2012 and Simpson et al., 
ACP, 2012 (VBS_acp2012 in earlier GenChem).
Updated:
 - using YOXY etc,
 - updated reaction rates to new IUPAC recommendations (consistent with EmChem19)
