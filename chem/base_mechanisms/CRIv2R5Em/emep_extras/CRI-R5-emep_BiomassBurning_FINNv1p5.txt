# BiomassBurning mapping FINNv1.5 to CRI-R5-emep
#  Column-1 gives FINNv1 species ,
#  Column-2 gives the product of two numbers:
#    1) MW if needed to get to kg/day. Not needed for FINNv1
#       (Some FINN emissions are given with mass basis, kg/day, so just
#         set to 1.0. Others are given as mole/day, so multiply by MW/1000
#         to get kg/day)
#    2) mass fraction of FINN emissions assign to EMEP species (usually 1.0)
#  Column-3 gives EMEP species
#
# Notes
# Gas-phase species only here. See extra_mechanisms directory for e.g.
# forest-fire of PM, BC, and tracer ffireCO.
