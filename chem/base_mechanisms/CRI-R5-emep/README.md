CRI-R5-emep
===========

Update of CRI_v2.1_R5 scheme with 2016 isoprene chemistry from Mike Jenkin.
-- combined CRIv2R5 and Isoprene C15_R1A (without SOA)
From Robert BergstrÃ¶m,  28 Nov 2016, adapted by Hannah & Dave for BoxChem

Similar to the gas-phase scheme used for global modelling in:

   McFiggans et al, Secondary organic aerosol reduced by mixture of
   atmospheric vapours, Nature, 565, 587-593, doi:10.1029/2018JD029133,
   2019

NB - uses 2 psuedo species, ISRO2 and MTO2 for SOA work

RB: Merging scheme with C15_R1A scheme for isoprene
    Assume CH3COO2 [CH3CO3] chemistry can be treated as in the CRI_v2_R5
      scheme (somewhat simplified compared to MCM)
     also keep CRI scheme for HOCH2CO3, CH3CO2H, CH3CHO (note different rate
      coefficient in MCM!?), 
     CH3O2 (some rates different in MCM?), CH3OOH, HCHO, 

*NOTABLE* changes include using the MCM species HCC7CO instead of the CRI
      species CARB17!
         for (non-photolysis) reactions involving HCC7CO the rates have been
      taken from MCM rather than CRI
         MCM has much faster reactions for this species than CRI.
         The RN18O2 and RN18AO2 radicals (and their products RN18OOH and
      RN18NO3) are removed based on MCM-chemistry.

For a number of species the names from the isoprene scheme (C15_R1A) were
      used instead of the CRI names
    e.g. CARB11A -> MEK; CARB7 -> ACETOL; CARB6 -> MGLYOX; CARB3 -> GLYOX; 

RB -- Update August 2017:
   The reaction rates were not updated to the latest recommendations here.
   Fixing this now.
   Also changing some photolysis rates to use the same photolysis as MCM
   Changing the name of CH3COO2 to CH3CO3 (to be the same as in MCM)


Updates Jan-Feb 2019 [RB]: 
   Some changes to groups: Changing name of PAN group to PANS
                           Adding some species to OXN group
                           Removing OXN groups for some radicals (to
                           avoid problems with EMEP code that at the
                           moment does not expect radicals in the groups)

   Switching to latest IUPAC recommended rates for a number of reactions
   This version was used in the model runs for the Isoprene CRIv2.2 manuscript by Mike Jenkin et al. (2019)
