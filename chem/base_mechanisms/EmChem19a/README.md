EmChem19a is an updated (bug fixed) version of EmChem19.

So far, the following things have been updated:

Deposition parameters added for C54CO and C5134CO2OH -- both are likely
highly soluble and are expected to deposit efficiently

For EmChem19a the BVOC_EmChem19 should be used for the monoterpene
chemistry.

Replaced PRRO2H by ACETOL (to save one advected species).


EmChem19 chemistry scheme was committed June 2019 for EMEP Report runs.

EmChem19 is an updated version of EmChem16x

  Simplified NO3 reactions for C5H8 and C3H6.

  Isoprene chemistry is largely based on the CheT2 scheme 

  Aromatic chemistry has been changed a little (but is still extremely limited)
    -- BENZENE and TOLUENE are added (only first reaction)

An extended version of EmChem19a, EmChem19X, which gives better night
time RO2 agreement with MCM is under development, but this needs more
reactions.
