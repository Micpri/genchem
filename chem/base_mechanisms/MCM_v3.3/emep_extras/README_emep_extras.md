EMEP extras
===========

**IMPORTANT: FOR MCM we have not yet set up these files (it is a bit heavy for 3-D modelling!).
The files have fake text which will crash any attempt to compile with emep-ctm. 

These files are not needed by boxChem though, so this scheme can be used via do.testChems.**

Biomass burning
---------------

So far two setups are needed, for either the FINN or GFAS sources of wildfires:

MCM_v3.3_BiomassBurningMapping_FINNv1.5.txt
MCM_v3.3_BiomassBurningMapping_GFASv1.txt


Boumdary condition mapping
--------------------------

MCM_v3.3_BoundaryConditions.txt
