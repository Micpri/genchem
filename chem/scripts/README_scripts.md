# Scripts for GenChem chem

## GenChem.py

The heart of these scripts is GenChem.py, which reads chemical
equations and converts them into fortran code for use in
the EMEP system of box, 1-D and 3-D codes.

## do.GenChem

Runs GenChem.py for desired base and extra chemical mechanisms. See
also box/scripts/do.testChems for alterative approach.


## GenChem_Shortands.txt

Master list of shorthands (from MCM), called before chem-specific settings
of chem subdirectories. Can be used with python3 versions.
