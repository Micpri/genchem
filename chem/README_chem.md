GenChem chem directory
======================

The _chem_ directory contains:

 * README_chem.md - this file

 * base_mechanisms

 * extra_mechanisms

 * scripts

 * inputs


The heart of the system is the script _GenChem.py_, which reads chemical
equations and converts them into fortran code for use in
the EMEP system of box, 1-D and 3-D codes. This is usually run via the
helper script _do.GenChem_, or even better from the box-model system and
_box/scripts/do.testChems_. (See box directory for more info, or read
the UsersGuide!)

The _base_ and _extra_ mechanism directories contain a number of  mechanisms
pre-prepared for GenChem usage. More information about the mechanism and 
role for GenChem can be found in the README files in each directory. For
each base\_mechanism we require three files, XXX_Species.csv, XXX_Reactions.txt
and XXX_Shorthands.txt. For extra\_mechanisms we require just XXX_Species.csv and XXX_Reactions.txt.


Formatting
-----------

Reactions files
...............


*   END-OF-LINE is ";" (not required in comment section)
*   Separator between rate coefficient and reaction is ":" * 
*   lines beginning with "*" are comments  
*   lines beginning with "rcemis" are emission terms  
*   lines beginning with "emisfiles" give name of  emission files, e.g. nox

        emisfile: nox, sox, voc


*   Some coefficients are defined in GenIn.shorthand, e.g. KHO2RO2 
*   Anything else is simply used as the rate coefficient.  

GenChem checks whether all shorthands used are also in
GenIn.species. For now, I have put some unused "products"
after the ";" EOL, e.g.HCOOH. 


Tracers, catalyists
...................

* Three  types of tracers allowed:

 1)   e.g. [OH] + VOC -> SOA   will put xnew(OH) into the loss rate
  of VOC, but will not change the loss rate of OH.

 2)   e.g. {O2} + OD -> OP   will ignore the O2 term. Make sure
 it is in the reaction rate though if needed!

 3)   e.g. OP + <O2> + <M> -> O3  will ignore the O2 and M term AND
  add their concentrations to the reaction rate (multiply it) -> it
  should not be there in the first place! And these species must be
  defined as own variable, e.g. O2(k) in the model itself



Base and Extra mechanisms
-------------------------

Base mechanisms
+++++++++++++++

A collection of chemical schemes adapted for GenChem usage. The schemes in
base_mechanisms usually consist of inorganic and hydrocarbon chemistry,
and for each mechanism we need the _Species.csv, _Reactions.txt and
_Shorthands.txt files.  Various reactions which can be added to these
schemes (e.g. gas-aerosol reactions) can be found in the extra_mechanisms
directory

Extra mechanisms
++++++++++++++++

A collection of chemical schemes adapted for GenChem usage. The schemes in
extra_mechanisms usually consist of reactions which can be appended to
the base_mechanisms. These extra mechanisms provide only 
 _Species.csv and _Reactions.txt files, not  the _Shorthands.txt files which
are required for base-mechanisms. 

### ShipNOx

Adds the special SHIPNOx species which is needed for global EMEP runs to
prevent over-efficient O3 generation.

### BVOC_MTERP1_EmChem19a

BVOC reactions in addition to EmChem19 basics

### BVOC_EmChem16mtx

Deprecated 

### PM_WoodFFuelInert

Provides emissions of Species such as POM_f_ffuel, EC_f_wood_age, remPPM25
and pSO4f (for those schemes that can use this). These PM compounds
are used in schemes which assume inert POM emissions (ie standard
EMEP policy runs).

### PM_VBS_EmChem19

This mechanism provides organic aerosol reactions as used in the
standard EMEP model of Simpson et al., Atmos. Chem. Physics, 2012 for
the EmChem09soa case - the latter is essentially produced by
doGenChem.py -b EmChem09 -e VBS_acp2012.

VBS denotes volatility basis set, from the work of Donahue, Robinson etc.,
and following the EMEP implementations documented in Bergstr√∂m et al.,
Atmos. Chem. Physics, 2012. (The EmChem09soa case uses inert emissions
of promary organic aerosol.)


### BoxAero

Some simple aerosol reactions for box-model studies only.

### Aero2017nx

Aerosol reactions for emep and esx

### Dust

As in EMEP

### SeaSalt

As in EMEP

### FFireInert

As in EMEP
