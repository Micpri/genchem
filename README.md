GenChem 
=======

This package contains the GenChem system, which
includes a chemical pre-processor (**GenChem.py**) for converting chemical
equations into differential form for use in atmospheric chemical transport
models (CTMs).  Although primarily intended for users of the EMEP MSC-W CTM and
related systems, GenChem also features a simple box-model testing system
(**boxChem**), which can run as a stand-alone chemical solver, enabling for
example easy testing of chemical mechanisms against each other.
